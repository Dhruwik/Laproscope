Using Physical Models in Gazebo

This guide explains how to import and use physical models in Gazebo and save them as .sdf files for your workspace.

Prerequisites

Gazebo installed on your system.

Internet access to browse Gazebo model library at app.gazebosim.org
.

Basic knowledge of terminal commands.

Steps
1. Launch Gazebo

Open a terminal and run:

cd PROJECTS/my_ros2_ws/src/laproscope_urdf/
gz sim --verbose 3 imp_file_1.sdf 

This launches Gazebo with verbose logging.

2. Open an Empty World

In Gazebo, select File → New World (or open an empty world file).

You now have a blank workspace to import models.

3. Open Resource Spawner

Click the three dots on the top-right corner.

Select Resource Spawner.

Note: The resource spawner may initially have no models downloaded to save space.

4. Browse Models Online

Open Chrome (or your browser) and go to Gazebo Model Library
.

Browse the ready-made models provided by different users.

5. Load a Model

In the Resource Spawner, enter your Gazebo username to see all your uploaded models.

Use the search bar to find the model you want.

Import the selected model to your workspace.

6. Save the Model as .sdf

Click the three-line menu (top-left).

Select Save File → choose location → save as .sdf.

You now have a .sdf file representing your Gazebo model.

7. Locate Model Assets

Open the .sdf file with a text editor.

Look for the include path in the file.

Copy the path from /home up to models.

For example, in terminal:

cd /home/dhruwik/.gz/fuel/fuel.gazebosim.org/openrobotics/models
xdg-open .


This opens the folder containing your imported model.

You can inspect how the model is structured and assets are stored.

8. Browse All Gazebo Models

To check all Gazebo models stored on your system:

cd
cd .gz && xdg-open .


Opens the .gz folder containing all downloaded models and assets.

Useful for quickly locating textures, meshes, and other resources.
